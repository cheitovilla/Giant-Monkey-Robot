# Giant-Monkey-Robot
Test Giant Monkey Robot

The project was developed in Unity 2019.3.0f1

In the Exporter_EXE folder we can find the executable file that runs in Windows.

   - Currently you can edit the rows but not the
    columns, i mean, add information in the DATA section in the Json, but not in
    the COLUMNHEADERS section because of the way it is developed.
    
    - Changing the name of the attributes in ColumnHeaders will also be reflected in
    the UI'
